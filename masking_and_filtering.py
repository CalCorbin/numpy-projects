1. Use np.linspace() to generate an evenly spaced array

Also, because of the particular calculation in this example, 
it makes life easier to have integers in the numbers array. 
But because the space between 5 and 50 doesnâ€™t divide evenly by 24, 
the resulting numbers would be floating-point numbers. 
You specify a dtype of int to force the function to round down
